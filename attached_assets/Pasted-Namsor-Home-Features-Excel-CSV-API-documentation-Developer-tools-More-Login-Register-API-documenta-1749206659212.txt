Introduction
About
The base endpoint URL is: https://v2.namsor.com/NamSorAPIv2
All endpoints require an API Key.
Never share your API key to ANYONE.
API Requests and Responses
All endpoints return JSON containing either an object or a nested array of objects.
Currently certain NamSor API endpoints use nested object structures in their query body and / or responses, please refer yourself to the corresponding code example.
Be aware that data in the code examples have been URL encoded into the corresponding ASCII code characters when necessary, for example 谢晓亮 is replaced by %E8%B0%A2%E6%99%93%E4%BA%AE. URLs cannot contain spaces or non-ASCII characters. When making GET requests to the API use URL encoding to convert non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the internet.
Data Privacy
By default Namsor's machine learning algorithm may improve data evaluation based on the data inputs and does store logs of submitted request. You may change these setting either in your user account or by calling the dedicated API endpoints. All data logs are secured using AES encryption before being stored.

If you wish to disable machine learning based on your submissions, please set learnable to false in the "Enhance privacy" section on the my account page. When set to false for an API key, the data processed using that key will not feed the machine learning algorithm.

If you wish to disable service usage history, please set anonymized to true in the "Enhance privacy" section on the my account page. When set to true for an API key, the data processed using that key will be irreversibly anonymised using SHA encryption. Note that the smart processing for redundant queries will still work even if your data is anonymised.

Authentication
API Key Creation
Customer accounts are common to all Namsor group websites. To create an API key visit Namsor or another site of the Namsor group and create an account. Navigate to the account information page to retrieve your API key. Your newly created account comes with 500 free credits that you may use immediately with any of Namsor's tools: API, CSV and Excel file processor or Developer tools.

API Key Installation
Your API key must be set in the header of your request using the X-API-KEY property. Please refer yourself to the provided code samples for correct key installation.

information
You must replace your-api-key with your Namsor API key.

Credits
What are Credits
We use a credit system to track usage. Each plan comes with a monthly quantity of credits and a price for request that exceed your monthly allowance. The free Basic subscription plan grants you 500 credits but other plans are available in case you have higher requirements. As an example, with 500 credits you can either:

Process 50 names to determine their origins.
Process 25 names to determine their ethnicities.
Process 50 names to determine their US race ethncities.
Process 50 names to determine their countries of residence.
Process 500 names to determine their genders.
information
Admin routes are free.

Repeated Operations Tolerance
Our API features smart processing and it will not charge for analyzing identical data for up to 20 times. For example if you submit the same full name 5 times in order to infer it's origin then you will only be charged 1 credit.

Soft Limit vs Hard Limit
In your user account you may set two types of credit usage limits:

A soft limit that will trigger an email notification when reached.
A hard limit that will trigger an email notification and block the API key when reached.
Track Usage
There are two ways to track your credit usage: check the provided graphics in your user account or query the appropriate Admin routes (API Usage, API Usage History and API Usage History Aggregate).

Errors
The NamSor API uses the following error codes:

401
Unauthorized
Missing or incorrect API Key.
403
Forbidden
API Limit Reached or API Key Disabled.
404
Not Found
The specified route could not be found.
500
Internal Server Error
Server error. Try again later.
Result Explainability
The Namsor API offers the ability to obtain a detailed explanation of how the artificial intelligence arrived at its results for a given request. By enabling this option, an additional field is included in the API response, providing a Python code explanation of the process followed by the AI.

Important
Additional Cost: Activating explainability incurs an extra cost of 50 credits per name processed.
Explanation Format: The returned explanation is in Python code. For optimal use, it is recommended to remove tabs and carriage returns so that the code is usable.
How to Activate Explainability:
Contact the Namsor Team: Before using this feature, please contact our team to activate the explainability option on your client account.
Configure the Request: Add the following header to your API request:
X-OPTION-EXPLANABILITY: true
Copy
By following these steps, each request will now include a detailed explanation of the result, allowing you to gain deep insights into the workings of our artificial intelligence specialized in onomastics.

AI Act Use Case
The Namsor API can be instrumental in complying with national or supra-national regulations aimed at preventing biased results and discriminatory effects in Artificial Intelligence. Namsor is capable of inferring special categories of personal data from names to estimate the risk of algorithmic biases related to gender, race, cultural/linguistic background, ethnicity, or country of origin.

The European AI Act introduces a new exception regarding “sensitive data” to protect citizens' rights from discrimination that might arise due to bias in AI systems. For the purpose of ensuring bias detection and correction in high-risk AI systems, it permits the processing of special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest.

Namsor's Explainability Option is designed to provide a closed mathematical formula that includes the entire explanation of name classification (with both training data features and complete model formulas). This can be stored for audit purposes in decision-making AI algorithms.

To protect Namsor's intellectual property, we require specific documentation and a signed NDA before activating this option.

Origin from names
Namsor helps you find thorough information about the origin of a name by establishing a name's country of origin, the ethnicity, the diaspora and the US race classification. We also provide a corridor evalutation API, to check background information about international interactions.

Name Origin
Name Origin feature analyzes a first name and/or a last name to identify its country of origin with slightly improved accuracy than the Full Name Origin feature. Adding a first and last name increases the accuracy of the determined origin.
The feature returns the region of origin, the country of origin, and a list of the top 10 countries of origin, ordered from most likely to least likely. Each country of origin returned is accompanied by a calibrated probability.

Note that the name diaspora feature may be better suited for multicultural countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand and other "melting-pots".

Gender from names
Namsor's name checking API can help you determine the probability of a person being male or female based on their name. We offer many processing options for gender determination, the name can either be provided: as a full name, as a first name and a last name. In addition to the name you may specify the country of origin to improve accuracy. Our API also supports Chinese names, Japanese names and a large number of additional alphabets*.

Genderize Name
Genderize Name feature analyzes a first name and a last name (optional) to identify its most likely gender with slightly improved accuracy than the Genderize Full Name feature. Adding a first and last name increases the accuracy of the determined gender.
The feature returns the most likely gender accompanied by a calibrated probability. If the probability of the returned gender is between 45% and 55%, the name can be interpreted as a unisex name.

POST
GET
Description: Returns the most likely gender of up to 100 first names and last names (optional).
Precision:Precision gauge
Cost: 1 credit per name.

Genderize Full Name
Genderize Full Name feature analyzes an unsplit full name (first name and last name) to identify its most likely gender.
The feature returns the most likely gender accompanied by a calibrated probability. If the probability of the returned gender is between 45% and 55%, the name can be interpreted as a unisex name.

Name Type Recognition
Namsor provides a specialized proper name type determination API, it is trained to analyse proper names and infer if they are personal names (anthroponym), a geographic name (toponym) or brand names. Differentiate individuals from companies base on their name in order to automate processes, evaluate references to names or leverage deeper insight into an audience. To yield improved results you may indicate the name's country of origin.

Name Type
Name Type feature analyzes a proper noun to determine if it's the name of a person (anthroponym), a geographic name (toponym), an alias of a person (pseudonym) or the name of a brand. We recommend that you submit the entire name (full name) if applicable.

Japanese names
Namsor provides a specialized name processing API dedicated to analysing names in the Japanese language. We have developed a name converter, focused on Japanese names, to help you find the best transcriptions possible. With our API, you can convert Japanese names both ways between Kanji and English. You can evaluate the quality of a transcriptions between a name in Kanji and a name in Latin characters. It is also possible to split Japansese full names, in either Kanji or Latin characters, into a first name and a last name as well as establish the gender of a name.

Translate Japanese Name To Latin
Translate Japanese Name To Latin feature converts a Japanese given name or a Japanese surname (or both for more precision) written in Kanji characters, into Latin alphabet. The conversion of a Japanese name written in Kanji into Latin alphabet is called romanization. Several conversions for the same name are possible. This is why the feature returns a list of converted names, accompanied by a calibrated probability and sorted from most likely to least likely.

Description: Returns the most likely latin transcriptions for up to 100 Japanese given names and/or surnames in Kanji characters.
