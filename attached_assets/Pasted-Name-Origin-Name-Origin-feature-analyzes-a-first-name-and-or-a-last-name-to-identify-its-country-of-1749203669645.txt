Name Origin

Name Origin feature analyzes a first name and/or a last name to identify its country of origin with slightly improved accuracy than the Full Name Origin feature. Adding a first and last name increases the accuracy of the determined origin.
The feature returns the region of origin, the country of origin, and a list of the top 10 countries of origin, ordered from most likely to least likely. Each country of origin returned is accompanied by a calibrated probability.

Note that the name diaspora feature may be better suited for multicultural countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand and other "melting-pots".

    Description: Returns the most likely country of origin of up to 100 first names and/or last names.

Full Name Origin

Full Name Origin feature analyzes an unsplit full name (first name and last name) to identify its country of origin.
The feature returns the region of origin, the country of origin, and a list of the top 10 countries of origin, ordered from most likely to least likely. Each country of origin returned is accompanied by a calibrated probability.

Note that the name diaspora feature may be better suited for multicultural countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand and other "melting-pots".
